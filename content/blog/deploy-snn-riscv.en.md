## Introduction

Deploying spiking neural networks (SNNs) on RISC-V architectures is a key step in making neuromorphic AI accessible to resource-constrained IoT devices. In this article, we explore how to use the QEMU emulator to test and deploy SNN models on a RISC-V architecture.

### Why Use QEMU?

QEMU is an open-source emulator that allows simulating hardware architectures, including RISC-V. It is particularly useful for:
- Testing SNN models without needing physical hardware.
- Debugging and optimizing model performance before deployment on real hardware.

### Steps to Deploy an SNN Model on RISC-V with QEMU

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Install QEMU and configure it to emulate a RISC-V architecture.
   - Download or compile a RISC-V-compatible Linux kernel.

2. **Compiling the SNN Model**:
   - Use a framework like **NEST** or **Brian2** to compile your SNN model.
   - Export the model in a format compatible with the RISC-V environment.

3. **Running on QEMU**:
   - Load the SNN model into the emulated RISC-V environment.
   - Test the model and analyze its performance.

### Example Code

```bash
# Emulate a RISC-V architecture with QEMU
qemu-system-riscv64 -kernel bbl -nographic -append "root=/dev/vda ro" -hda rootfs.img
