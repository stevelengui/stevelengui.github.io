## Introduction

Hybrid models combining spiking neural networks (SNNs) and quantized neural networks (QNNs) offer a balance between energy efficiency and accuracy. In this article, we explore how to implement such a model on a RISC-V accelerator using the QEMU emulator.

### Why a Hybrid SNN-QNN Model?

Hybrid SNN-QNN models combine the advantages of both approaches:
- **SNN**: Low energy consumption and real-time processing.
- **QNN**: Increased accuracy through weight and activation quantization.

### Steps to Implement a Hybrid SNN-QNN Model on RISC-V with QEMU

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Configure QEMU to emulate a RISC-V accelerator.
   - Install the necessary libraries to run SNN and QNN models.

2. **Compiling the Hybrid Model**:
   - Use a framework like **TensorFlow Lite** or **PyTorch** to compile the hybrid model.
   - Export the model in a format compatible with RISC-V.

3. **Running on QEMU**:
   - Load the hybrid model into the emulated RISC-V environment.
   - Test the model and analyze its performance.

### Example Code

```bash
# Emulate a RISC-V accelerator with QEMU
qemu-system-riscv64 -kernel bbl -nographic -append "root=/dev/vda ro" -hda rootfs.img
