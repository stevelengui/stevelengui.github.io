  Résumé : The proliferation of IoT devices necessitates energy-efficient AI solutions that balance computational demands with power constraints.
RISC-V, an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), has emerged as a transformative platform for deploying
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs), and Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) in edge devices.
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of these implementations, focusing on their energy efficiency, latency, and
hardware-software co-design. Recent advancements from 2024–2025 are highlighted, demonstrating RISC-V’s superiority over
ARM architectures in energy efficiency (up to 60 percent) and inference latency (up to 50 percent) reference 2. The study also identifies
unresolved challenges in thermal management, memory optimization, and standardization, proposing novel solutions for future
research.

- **Implementation of Hybrid Spiking-Quantized Neural Networks on RISC-V for Resource-Constrained IoT Devices**  
  *Elsevier to Microprocessors and Microsystems journal*

  Résumé : This paper presents the implementation of a hybrid Spiking Neural Network (SNN) and Quantized Neural Network (QNN) on
RISC-V architecture for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed model combines the energy efficiency
of SNNs with the computational efficiency of QNNs, making it suitable for low-power IoT applications. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the hybrid model through training on the MNIST dataset, achieving a validation accuracy of 95.1%. The trained
model is then optimized and deployed on a RISC-V platform using the QEMU emulator, showcasing its feasibility for embedded
AI applications. The results highlight the potential of hybrid neural networks in enabling advanced machine learning capabilities
on resource-constrained hardware. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods and discuss
future directions for research in this area.
