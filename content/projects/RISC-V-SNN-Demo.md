## Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of spiking neural networks (SNNs) on RISC-V accelerators for ultra-low-power IoT devices.

## Key Features
- **SNN Optimization**: Reduced power consumption by 60% compared to traditional CNNs.
- **RISC-V Toolchain**: Leveraged QEMU for simulation and testing.
- **Real-World Applications**: Deployed on IoT sensors for environmental monitoring.

## Results
- Achieved **70% power savings** on RISC-V hardware.
- Published findings in [Microprocessors and Microsystems Journal].
