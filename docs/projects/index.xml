      <description>Overview This project demonstrates the deployment of spiking neural networks (SNNs) on RISC-V accelerators for ultra-low-power IoT devices.
Key Features  SNN Optimization: Reduced power consumption by 60% compared to traditional CNNs. RISC-V Toolchain: Leveraged QEMU for simulation and testing. Real-World Applications: Deployed on IoT sensors for environmental monitoring.  Results  Achieved 70% power savings on RISC-V hardware. Published findings in [Microprocessors and Microsystems Journal]  Code Repository Check out the code on GitHub.</description>
