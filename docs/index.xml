      <description>Introduction This post explores techniques for optimizing edge AI Hybrid models SNNs and QNNs on RISC-V hardware with qemu emulator.
Key Techniques  Quantization: Reduced model size by 4x with minimal accuracy loss. Pruning: Removed redundant neurons for faster inference. Hardware-Aware Optimization: Tailored models for RISC-V accelerators.  Results  Achieved 2x faster inference on RISC-V compared to ARM Cortex-M. Published findings in [Microprocessors and Microsystems Journal].  Code Repository Check out the code on GitHub.</description>
